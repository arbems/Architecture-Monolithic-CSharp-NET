   ///    By default, WCF services return fault messages with an HTTP 500 response code.
   ///    Due to limitations in the browser networking stack, the bodies of these messages are inaccessible within
   ///    Silverlight,
   ///    and consequently the fault messages cannot be read by the client.
   ///    To send faults that will be accessible to a Silverlight client, a WCF service must modify the way it sends its fault
   ///    messages.
   ///    The key change needed is for WCF to return fault messages with an HTTP 200 response code instead of the HTTP 500
   ///    response code.
   ///    This change enables Silverlight to read the body of the message and also enables WCF clients of the same service to
   ///    continue
   ///    working using their normal fault-handling procedures.
