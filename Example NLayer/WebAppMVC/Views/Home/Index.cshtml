    <p class="lead">Domain-driven design (DDD) is an approach to software development for complex needs by connecting the implementation to an evolving model.[1] The premise of domain-driven design is the following:</p>
    <p>- placing the project's primary focus on the core domain and domain logic;</p>
    <p>- basing complex designs on a model of the domain;</p>
    <p>- initiating a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses particular domain problems.</p>
